The MATLAB code in this contribution is used to determine Lyapunov exponent spectrum of Fractional-Order Systems (FOS), including three classical examples: the fractional-order Lorenz system, the 4D fractional-order Chen system, and the fractional-order Duffing oscillator. The algorithm is based on the memory principle of fractional order derivatives and has no restriction on the dimension and order of the system. When the order is set to 1, the numerical method automatically reduces to a forward Euler scheme, so the program can also be used to determine the Lyapunov exponents of integer-order systems. See the corresponding published paper in Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 2023, 168: 113167 for a detailed theoretical discussion on the algorithm.
